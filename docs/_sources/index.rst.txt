=====================================================================================================

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task that aims to identify and classify named entities (e.g. people, organizations,

This project provides models for the NER task and algorithms to train, test, and evaluate the proposed models.

We divided the project into four modules, the documentation for each one is available below.
